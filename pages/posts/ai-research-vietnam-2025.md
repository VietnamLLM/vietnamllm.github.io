```python
# Example: Vietnamese text preprocessing
import re

def preprocess_vietnamese_text(text):
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text.strip())
    
    # Handle Vietnamese diacritics
    text = text.lower()
    
    return text

# Usage example
sample_text = "Xin chào, đây là một ví dụ về xử lý văn bản tiếng Việt"
processed = preprocess_vietnamese_text(sample_text)
print(processed)
```

### Computer Vision

Key areas of development:

- **Object Detection**: Real-time detection in traffic and security systems
